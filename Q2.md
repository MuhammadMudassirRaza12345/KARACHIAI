You have already inserted Data from Financial Consumer Complaints ETL Assignment, use the same table to create some Procedures, Triggers and Views

Data Source: Financial Consumer Complaints Data inserted in Airflow Assignment. (Incase you haven't submitted the Airflow assignment then you can use the attached script to create table in your MySQL Database)

Create the Following Database Objects:

1.       Creating a View (5 Marks):

Create a view “complaints_last_3_months_sum” of Number of Complaints received against the following attributes in last three months use “date_received” column, use the Original Table & Data you have from Airflow Assignment Dump:

4.       sub_product
5.       sub_issue
